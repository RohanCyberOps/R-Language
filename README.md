# R Language Projects

Welcome to the **R Language Projects** directory. This repository contains various projects, scripts, and experiments developed using **R**, a powerful statistical computing and data visualization language.

## Project Structure
Each project is organized in its own subdirectory and may include:
- `sample data` – Datasets used for analysis (if applicable)
- `scripts/` – R scripts and functions
- `notebooks/` – RMarkdown or Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration
- `results/` – Generated plots, reports, or model outputs

## Prerequisites
To work with these projects, ensure you have:
- **R (latest version)** – Download from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- **RStudio** (optional but recommended) – [Download here](https://posit.co/downloads/)
- Required R packages – Install using:
  ```r
  install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "shiny", "caret"))
  ```

## Key Projects
- **Data Visualization** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with `ggplot2`
- **Machine Learning** – Predictive modeling using `caret`
- **Web Apps** – Interactive dashboards with `shiny`
- **Statistical Analysis** – Regression, hypothesis testing, and more
